## Summary

Order Up is a clone of the popular game card game, Set. You are an employee of
an unusual cafe and have to trow together orders for customers. These orders,
represented by cards, have strict rules to them. Each card has 4 attributes:
Color, Fill/Shading, Number of items, and Item Type. A valid order consists of 3
cards where each attribute across the cards is either all teh same or all
different.

This project began as an introduction project to web sockets. It is a full
featured multiplayer card game with in-game chat, avatar customization, and
matchmaking.

The individual games are all run completely on the back end.
